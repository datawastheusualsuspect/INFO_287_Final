Research Problem and Proposed Solution
Problem Statement
The integrity of social media discourse is increasingly compromised by "Social Bots"?algorithmic accounts designed to mimic human behavior to manipulate public opinion, inflate influence, or spread spam. While early automation was easily identifiable through high-volume spamming, modern bots have evolved into sophisticated "cyborgs" (Ferrara et al., 2016). These actors employ complex strategies such as organic sleep cycles, varied vocabulary, and "infiltration" tactics?following human users to solicit reciprocal follows. A critical challenge in detecting these actors within the specific "Nutella" dataset provided is the lack of "Ground Truth"; there are no pre-existing labels indicating which users are bots and which are humans, rendering traditional supervised classification methods impossible.
Proposed Solution
I aim to solve this problem by implementing a Multi-Modal Forensic Pipeline. Instead of relying on a single metric, I triangulate bot behavior using three theoretical frameworks: Computational Linguistics (to measure information density), Network Statistics (to detect structural infiltration), and Unsupervised Learning. By applying K-Means Clustering, I aim to mathematically partition the dataset into distinct behavioral groups, isolating the "inauthentic" actors based on their statistical distance from organic users.
Research Questions
RQ1 (The Turing Test): Can quantifiable linguistic features and temporal signatures reliably distinguish an automated account from a human in an unlabeled dataset?
RQ2 (The Infiltration Test): Do specific clusters exhibit the "Infiltration" signature (a high ratio of friends to followers) indicative of spam behavior?
Data Analysis and Algorithm
Data Loading and Integrity
The dataset consisted of raw tweets containing the keyword "Nutella." Initial inspection revealed significant noise, including Python byte-string artifacts and unicode escape sequences. I implemented a clean_tweet_text function using Regular Expressions to strip these artifacts. Data integrity was verified by inspecting the first 10 rows of the dataframe pre-and-post cleaning to ensure text normalization was successful before feature engineering.
Variables
Outcome Variable: The outcome is the assigned Cluster (
k
=
0
k=0
 or 
k
=
1
k=1
), a categorical variable derived from the K-Means algorithm representing the behavioral group.
Predictors: I engineered four specific predictors to drive the clustering:
Linguistic Entropy (
H
H
): Measures the randomness/complexity of the text.
Infiltration Ratio: Calculated as 
Friends
Followers
+
1
Followers+1
Friends
?
 
.
Sentiment Polarity: Measures emotional tone (-1 to +1).
Log Retweet Count: Measures content impact.
Note: TF-IDF vectors were also used as high-dimensional predictors for the content analysis.
Method of Analysis
I employed K-Means Clustering as the primary method of analysis. This Unsupervised Learning technique was chosen specifically because the data is unlabeled. K-Means minimizes the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) to find natural groupings in the data. Additionally, I applied TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text vectorization. This was necessary because every row contained the word "Nutella"; simple word counts would have been statistically useless. TF-IDF allowed the algorithm to penalize the common topic and focus on differentiating vocabulary (e.g., "Giveaway" vs. "Breakfast").
Checking Relationships
I checked for relationships and collinearity using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Specifically, I utilized histograms to check the distribution of the predictors. I looked for bimodal distributions (two distinct "humps" in the data), which suggests that the data naturally separates into two groups. This validated the choice of 
k
=
2
k=2
 for the clustering algorithm.

 is the Euclidean Distance between a data point and its cluster centroid.
To visualize this high-dimensional model:
Scatter Plot: I plotted Entropy (X) vs. Infiltration Ratio (Y) to visualize the separation.
Radar Chart: I mapped the normalized centroids of each cluster to visualize their "Digital DNA."
Heatmap: I plotted Hour vs. Minute frequencies to visualize temporal relationships.
Insights from Visualizations
The visualizations provided the following forensic insights:
The Scatter Plot revealed a distinct cluster in the top-left quadrant (High Infiltration, Low Entropy). This confirms the presence of "Follow-Back Spam Bots" who aggressively follow others but use repetitive templates.
The Heatmap revealed vertical stripes at minutes :00, :15, and :30, indicating robotic scheduling (Cron jobs) rather than organic biological rhythms.
The Word Clouds (weighted by TF-IDF) confirmed that the "Inauthentic" cluster used vocabulary related to promotions ("Win", "Free"), while the "Organic" cluster discussed consumption ("Eat", "Toast").
Algorithm Evaluation
Since standard metrics like Accuracy or Recall cannot be calculated without ground truth, I evaluated the algorithm using Qualitative Interpretation and Silhouette Logic. The distinct separation of the clusters in the Scatter Plot and the coherent, distinct vocabularies observed in the comparative Word Clouds serve as validation that the algorithm successfully distinguished between two fundamentally different types of user behavior.
Addressing Peer Review
Note: As this is an independent project, the following represents the self-correction process based on hypothetical peer feedback typical for this analysis.
Feedback 1: "Why use K=2?"
Response: I initially considered using the Elbow Method to find the optimal 
k
k
. However, based on the research problem (Bots vs. Humans), a binary split (
k
=
2
k=2
) is the most logical starting point for forensic triage. I maintained 
k
=
2
k=2
 to ensure the results were interpretable as "Organic" vs. "Suspicious."
Feedback 2: "The word clouds look generic."
Response: Initial word clouds were dominated by the word "Nutella." To address this, I switched from raw frequency counts to TF-IDF Weighted word clouds. This successfully filtered out the common keyword and revealed the underlying narrative differences (promotional vs. conversational).
Feedback 3: "How do you know the Infiltration Ratio works?"
Response: I added the Scatter Plot specifically to validate this metric. By plotting it against Entropy, I visually proved that high infiltration correlates with low linguistic complexity, validating it as a signal of automation.
